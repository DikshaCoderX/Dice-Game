# Dice-Game
A Dice Roll Game is a simple web project that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript . In this project,  we create a virtual dice with a visual representation, such as a cube or square, and use JavaScript to generate random numbers when a user interacts with the "Roll" button. The numbers are then displayed as the result of the dice roll.
